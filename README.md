# Google Maps
A plugin for Unreal Engine 4 that enables GoogleMap objects on Android. Work in progress. 

## Prerequisites
The Google Play Services Java Libraries included with UE are r19. This needs to be upgraded to r29 to work with this plugin.

Download here: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/google_play_services_8487000_r29.zip

Extract to (UE Engine directory)\Engine\Build\Android\Java\JavaLibs.

Delete / move the old "google-play-services_lib_rev19" folder out of here too, or you'll get build errors.
